  Here, we are taking the role of the consumer participant. 
  
  First, we inspect the providers catalog. There we should find the asset, that was prepared in the previous stage. 
  
  Then we trigger a negotiation process, and check its (hopefully positive) outcome. 
  
  After that, we initiate a transfer process based on the previously negotiated contract. In the following step, we retrieve the authorization token, which the provider will give us. 
  
  And finally, we are using that token to get access to the data, that was placed inside the provider's asset.

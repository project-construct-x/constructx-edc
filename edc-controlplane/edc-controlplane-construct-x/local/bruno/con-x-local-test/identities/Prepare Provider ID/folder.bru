  The requests in this folder are necessary for creating the identity of the provider participant. 
  We are doing an initial registration at the identity hub. Then we take a look at the created DID document. Then we trigger a credential request toward the trusted issuer. And also, we are storing the STS secret that the identity hub gave us, at the vault.
